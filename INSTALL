INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR MPSPACK

The project is hosted at the repository http://code.google.com/p/mpspack

Requirements: Matlab version 7.6 (2008a) or newer is needed,
since we make heavy use of recent object-oriented programming features.
No other Matlab toolboxes are needed.
If you wish to use faster regular Bessel functions you may want to
install the GNU Scientific Library.

There are also some optional fast basis and other math libraries (C
and Fortran with MEX interfaces) included in MPSPACK, that you might
want to benefit from. These should be compiled in a UNIX environment
as follows: Edit the file "make.inc" in the MPSPACK directory,
changing the locations of GSL and BLAS librares to match those on your
system.  Then from this directory type "make".

If, on the other hand, you do not choose (or are unable) to compile the
above, then you should edit the file @utils/inpolywrapper.m as follows:
comment out the last line and uncomment the
first code line labelled "Matlab's native inpolygon". This will give you
a slower version of checking if points are inside polygons, but will get
you going.

In either case, you should now add the MPSPACK directory to your
MATLAB path, for instance by adding the line

	  addpath 'path/to/mpspack';

to your MATLAB startup.m file.
You are now ready to use MPSPACK !
