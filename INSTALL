INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR MPSPACK - version 1.33 of 10/24/13

The project is hosted at the repository http://code.google.com/p/mpspack

Requirements: Matlab version 7.6 (2008a) or newer is needed, since we
make heavy use of recent object-oriented programming features.  No
other Matlab toolboxes are needed.  The package should work out of the
box, although some aspects may be unnecessarily slow; see below.

You should now add the MPSPACK directory to your MATLAB path, for
instance by adding the line

	  addpath 'path/to/mpspack';

to your MATLAB startup.m file. You are now ready to use MPSPACK !

Tweaks & speedups:

1) If you want to use faster inside-polygon checking, and you
have a 64-bit linux or 32/64-bit Windows environment, try the following:
edit the file @utils/inpolywrapper.m as follows:
comment out the first code line labelled "Matlab's native inpolygon",
and uncomment the last line. This will use Bruno Luong's inpolygon
MEX files (which are 100x faster than MATLAB 2012a or earlier).
You may test it works by running test/testdomain.m without errors.

2) If you wish to use faster regular Bessel functions you may want to
install the GNU Scientific Library.  http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
There are also some optional fast basis and other math libraries (C
and Fortran with MEX interfaces) included in MPSPACK, that you might
want to benefit from. These should be compiled in a UNIX environment
as follows: Edit the file "make.inc" in the MPSPACK directory,
changing the locations of GSL and BLAS librares to match those on your
system.  Then from this directory type "make".
