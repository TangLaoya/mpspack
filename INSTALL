INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR MPSPACK - version 1.31 of 10/9/12

The project is hosted at the repository http://code.google.com/p/mpspack

Requirements: Matlab version 7.6 (2008a) or newer is needed, since we
make heavy use of recent object-oriented programming features.  No
other Matlab toolboxes are needed.  If you wish to use faster regular
Bessel functions you may want to install the GNU Scientific Library.

There are also some optional fast basis and other math libraries (C
and Fortran with MEX interfaces) included in MPSPACK, that you might
want to benefit from. These should be compiled in a UNIX environment
as follows: Edit the file "make.inc" in the MPSPACK directory,
changing the locations of GSL and BLAS librares to match those on your
system.  Then from this directory type "make".

As of version 1.31, MPSpack now comes with Bruno Luong's inpolygon
checking, and his MEX files are supplied for a64 (linux), w32 and w64
(windows) environments. If for some reason this fails (eg test with
test/testdomain.m), edit the file @utils/inpolywrapper.m as follows:
comment out the last line and uncomment the first code line labelled
"Matlab's native inpolygon". This will give you a 100x slower version
of checking if points are inside polygons, but will get you going.

You should now add the MPSPACK directory to your MATLAB path, for
instance by adding the line

	  addpath 'path/to/mpspack';

to your MATLAB startup.m file. You are now ready to use MPSPACK !
