\section{Layer potentials}
\label{s:layer}

Layer potentials are representations of Helmholtz solutions
involving an integral over a surface, i.e. a boundary segment
\cite{coltonkress}.
They are similar the MFS representations discussed above, with the
crucial advantage that a {\em second-kind}
formulation is often possible, i.e. the operator involved is
identity plus compact, and the resulting matrix problems are well-conditioned.
It is easy to set up single- and double-layer potentials (SLP and
DLP) living on
segment $\Gamma$ (see the manual for their definitions).
For example, using as $\Gamma$ the
trefoil segment {\tt tref} defined in Sec.~\ref{s:ext}, a DLP is set up
by
\begin{verbatim}
  d = domain([], [], tref, -1); d.k = 10;    % external domain, wavenumber k
  d.addlayerpot([], 'd');                    % adds DLP to bdry of d
\end{verbatim}

The coefficients in {\tt p.co} represent density function values
at the quadrature points.

TO FINISH. KEEP BREIF.
