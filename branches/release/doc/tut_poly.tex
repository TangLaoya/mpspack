\section{Polygons, corners, and corner-adapted bases}
\label{s:poly}

So far each disconnected boundary piece of the domain
has been a single segment connected to itself head-to-tail.
More generally, a {\em list} of segments may be used to create 
these closed boundary pieces, as long as the last in the list
connects back to the starting point of the first.
For instance, a triangle is built from sending a list of
three line segments to the domain command;
this list may conveniently be made with a polygon constructor,
\begin{verbatim}
   s = segment.polyseglist([], [1, 1i, exp(4i*pi/3)]);
   tri = domain(s, 1);
\end{verbatim}
Since {\tt s} is a 1-by-3 array of (handles to) segments,
the 2nd argument is automatically vectorized to {\tt [1 1 1]}.
Each of the segments could have been made separately, e.g.\ the first by
\co{s(1) = segment([], [1 1i]);}
Fig.~\ref{f:doms}b shows {\tt tri.plot} output for this domain.%
  \footnote{Notice that periodic quadrature would now be inappropriate:
    in fact $M=20$ point Clenshaw-Curtis is used by default for open
    segments}

Let's discuss corners: their angles are indicated by the solid black
`fans' in the plot (before now these have had angle $\pi$, hence semicircles).
A black fan at the junction of two segments indicates that a corner
linkage was made (warnings will be given if any segment ends are left
dangling), and shows the angle range pointing {\em into} the domain.
%The data is stored in the domain properties as {\tt tri.
%and their start and end angles

Segment lists may also be sent to the excluded arguments of the
domain constructor, for instance to create the domain exterior
to the triangle,
\co{exttri = domain([], [], s(end:-1:1), -1);}
where it was important to reverse the order of the segment list,
since each was 
or to create the domain exterior to two nearby triangles,
\begin{verbatim}
   ss = s.translate(2);
   exttwotri = domain([], [], {s(end:-1:1), ss(end:-1:1)}, {-1, -1});
\end{verbatim}
We remind the reader that to create the above domains
using the existing segment array {\tt s}, each time a {\tt s.disconnect}
would be needed beforehand (this acts on all segments in the list).%
  \footnote{Also note that the domains previously linked to the segments, such
    as {\tt tri}, would be left `dangling' since {\tt s} no longer is linked
    back to them. Attempts to use {\tt tri} in a BVP would now be doomed
    unless the data {\tt s(:).dom} were manually rewritten to point to
    the domain (see manual). When in doubt, disconnect segments then remake
    all domains.}
A universal rule is:
\begin{center}\framebox{\mbox{Each side of a segment may be associated with
at most one domain}}\end{center}

\ca{a) Comparing convergence of boundary error norm for Fourier Bessel
vs corner-adapted fractional-order Fourier Bessel basis sets
in a triangle with unity Dirichlet boundary data, for Helmholtz
BVP with $k=10$, on log-log axes. b) The solution function.}{f:triconv}
\efi

Say we want to solve an interior Helmholtz BVP on the original triangle
of this section, and {\tt s} and {\tt tri} have been set up as with the
first two commands of this section but with $M=50$ quadrature points.
Say we want constant boundary data 1.
We may use a Fourier-Bessel basis set, solve, and
plot error convergence with a simple code,
\begin{verbatim}
   s.setbc(-1, 'd', [], @(t) 1);             % note inline "1" function
   tri.addregfbbasis(0, []); tri.bas{1}.rescale_rad = 1.0; % for stability
   p = bvp(tri);
   tri.k = 10;                               % set wavenumber
   Ns = 2:2:40; for i=1:numel(Ns)
     tri.bas{1}.N = Ns(i); p.solvecoeffs; r(i) = p.bcresidualnorm;
   end
   figure; loglog(2*Ns, r, '+-'); xlabel('# dofs'); ylabel('bdry err norm');
\end{verbatim}
This produces the algebraic convergence%
  \footnote{The power law for convergence is related to the largest corner
angles and is discussed in \cite{Ei74}.}
shown in blue in Fig.~\ref{f:triconv}a.

We now show how corner-adapted basis sets may enhance
the above basis set to achieve superior convergence and hence
more efficiency. We clear the previous basis set from the domain
and add fractional-order (i.e. `wedge' expansion) Fourier Bessel bases
at two of the corners, of both cos and sin type.%
  \footnote{Since only one of the corners is
    singular, it is possible to omit a corner
    expansion from one of the other corners, for instance the 3rd one.
    This done with the options {\tt opts.cornerflags = [1 1 0];}.}
Repeating the convergence
study and comparing against the previous data is easy,
%super-algebraic ?
\begin{verbatim}
tri.clearbases; opts.rescale_rad = 1.9; opts.cornerflags = [1 1 0];
tri.addcornerbases([], opts);
Ns = 1:20; for i=1:numel(Ns)
  p.updateN(Ns(i)); nn(i) = p.N; p.solvecoeffs; r(i) = p.bcresidualnorm;
end
hold on; loglog(4*Ns, r, 'r+-');                % total # dofs is 4N
\end{verbatim}
The new convergence data is shown in red in Fig.~\ref{f:triconv}a;
initially it is superalgebraic.
[WHY IS IT NOT SUPER-ALGEBRAIC, TIMO? IT IS ALSO too SENSITIVE to rescalerad - WHY?]
The solution field is Fig.~\ref{f:triconv}b, and its large values
shows that we are close to a Dirichlet resonance of the domain.
Since only one of the corners is singular, it is possible to omit a corner
expansion from one of the other corners, for instance the 3rd one, by
using {\tt opts.cornerflags = [1 1 0];}.
Finally the basis sets geometry in the domain can be visualized by
{\tt tri.showbasesgeom;} which shows the wedges implied by the corner
expansions.
