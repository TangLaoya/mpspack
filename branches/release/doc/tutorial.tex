\begin{abstract}
This is a short tutorial showing how man two-dimensional Laplace and Helmholtz
boundary-value problems
may be numerically solved simply and accurately with the \mpspack\ toolbox
for \matlab. We assume basic familiarity with \matlab\
and with partial differential equations.
%concept of particular-solution type numerical methods is assumed.

\section{About this tutorial}

This tutorial is designed for `bottom-up' learning of the features
of \mpspack, i.e.\ by progressing through simple examples.
In that sense it complements the user manual which describes
the theoretical framework in broad strokes and therefore could
be considered `top-down'.
We will skip most of the mathematics behind the solution techniques,
focusing on computing and plotting useful PDE solutions.

Throughout we will identify the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the complex
plane $\mathbb{C}$, by the usual map $z=x+iy$. In other words
$(2,3)$ and $2+3i$ represent the same point.
We use {\tt teletype} font to designate commands that may be typed
at the \matlab\ prompt.
You may get help on any \mpspack\ command by typing {\tt help command}.
All the code examples in this document, including code to generate the
figures, is found in the {\tt examples/} directory.
The codes for Sections \ref{s:lap}--\ref{s:layer} are named
\verb@tut_*.m@ according to the section names in {\tt tutorial.tex}.
