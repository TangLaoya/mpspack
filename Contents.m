% MPSpack: Method of Particular Solutions Package.
%
%          A MATLAB toolbox to solve Helmholtz and Laplace partial differential
%          equation and boundary-value problems in two dimensions, using
%          particular solutions, fundamental solutions, layer potentials, and
%          other global basis set methods. Highly accurate and efficient
%          solutions are able to be produced with just a few lines of code.
