Requirements: Matlab version 7.6 (2008a) or newer is needed,
since we make heavy use of recent object-oriented programming features.
No other Matlab toolboxes are needed.
If you wish to use faster regular Bessel functions you may want to
install the GNU Scientific Library.

The project is hosted at the repository {http://code.google.com/p/mpspack

There are some optional fast basis and other math libraries
(C and Fortran with MEX interfaces), which should be compiled
in a UNIX environment as follows: Adapt the location of your 
GSL and BLAS librares in the file "make.inc" in
the MPSPACK directory. Then from this directory type "make".

You should now add the MPSPACK
directory to your Matlab path, for instance by adding the line

	  addpath 'path/to/mpspack';

to your MATLAB startup.m file.
You are now ready to use MPSPACK !

For further info see the documentation and tutorial in MPSPACK\doc.
