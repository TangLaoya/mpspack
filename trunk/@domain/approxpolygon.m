function v = approxpolygon(s, pm)
% APPROXPOLYGON - stack together approximating polygon vertices of segment list
%
%  v = APPROXPOLYGON(seg, pm) returns a column vector of vertices (as
%   C-numbers) for the approximating polygon of a segment list seg and sign
%   list pm. If the segment list is not closed, v should not be interpreted
%   as a closed polygon.
