MPSpack Version 1.1 beta: INSTALLATION NOTES

Please note that if @utils/inpoly.c did not mex compile for you, you will
need to switch the choice of inside polygon tester called in
@utils/inpolywrapper.m as follows: comment out the last line and uncomment the
first code line labelled "Matlab's native inpolygon". This will be slower
but will get you going.
