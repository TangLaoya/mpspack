% MPSpack: Method of Particular Solutions Package.
%
%          A MATLAB toolbox to solve Helmholtz and Laplace partial differential
%          equation and boundary-value problems in two dimensions, using
%          particular solutions, fundamental solutions, and other global
%          basis set methods. Highly accurate and efficient solutions are
%          able to be produced with just a few lines of code.
